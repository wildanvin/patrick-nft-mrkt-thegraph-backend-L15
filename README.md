# Lesson 15 in Patrick's course. the graph back end

This sections is about setting the subgraph back end, some things I would like to remember:

- `subgraph.yaml` is a configuration file
- The way the graph handles data is in the `src` folder
- All the steps to publish the subgraph are in the Subgraph studio
- I should learn more about grpahQL
